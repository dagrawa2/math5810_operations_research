This repository contains some projects I completed for an operations research course. Each project is a linear programming problem and includes both a report (PDF) and code. Files with a "mod" extension contain GLPK code. Files with a "mws" extension are Maple 14 worksheets.

Projects include:

1. Computing the pseudoinverse of any matrix.

2. Finding the center and radius of the largest ball that can fit in any given polyhedron.

3. Implementing a polyhedral neural network that learns polyhedral decision boundaries.
